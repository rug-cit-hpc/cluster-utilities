description = 'TreeMix is a method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in the history of a set of populations.\
		In the underlying model, the modern-day populations in a species are related to a common ancestor via a graph of ancestral \
		populations. We use the allele frequencies in the modern populations to infer the structure of this graph. The details of the \
		TreeMix model are presented in: Pickrell JK and Pritchard JK, Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele \
		frequency data. \
               	Some extensions are presented in: Pickrell JK, Patterson N, Barbieri C, Berthold F, Gerlach L, GÃ¼ldemann T, Kure B, Mpoloka SW, \
		Nakagawa H, Naumann C, Lipson M, Loh PR, Lachance J, Mountain J, Bustamante CD, Berger B, Tishkoff SA, Henn BM, Stoneking M, \
               	Reich D, Pakendorf B. The genetic prehistory of southern Africa. \
               	We describe an application of this model to looking for natural selection in humans and dogs at Genomes Unzipped.'
