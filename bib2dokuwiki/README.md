# bib2dokuwiki

This contains a simple bash script that uses bib2bib and bibtex2html to 
divide a bibtex bibliography in years and generate an author sorted html 
formatted list of references for that year.
The file references.wiki is generated by concatenating header.wiki with the 
html files for each year.

Please check the output of the script for error messages, which may be caused
by issues in the bibtex bibliography.

The contents of the resulting references.wiki file can be inserted into
the dokuwiki page.

The bibtex style peregrine.bst has been generated using makebst.tex, which
is included in the custom-bib package. 
It can be run using:
```
latex makebst.tex
```
The resulting dbj file must be processed with tex, e.g:
```
tex peregrine.dbj
```
